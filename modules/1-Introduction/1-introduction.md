# Introduction

Hello and welcome to the first module in this short course designed to take you from 'Zero to Hero' with NetBox. We are excited to have you here! The goals of this course are as follows: 

- Enable you to get up and running with minimal fuss and immediatley start to get value from NetBox
- Build a solid foundation from which you can start to leverage NetBox's extra features ie. custom fields, reports, plugins etc
- Introduce the power of NetBox to drive your Network Automation efforts as the 'Single Source Of Truth' for your NetDevOps workflows

## Course Format
The course consists of bite sized modules, each one introducing a new concept or feauture of NetBox. Each module is a step in the journey that leads to the deployment of a new branch office network at a remote site for a fictional company. Each module includes a video teaching you how to interact with NetBox both via the Web UI and programatically using the REST API. You can follow along with your own instance of NetBox, and all code used to interact with the REST API will be available in a Git repo and Postman collection, so you will have a fully working code base which you can clone to get you started!
