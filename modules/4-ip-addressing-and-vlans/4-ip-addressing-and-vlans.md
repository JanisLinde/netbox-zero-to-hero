# Introduction

Hello and welcome to module 4 of the NetBox 'Zero-to-Hero' course. In [Module 3: Adding the Kit](3-adding-the-kit.md) you learned how to...
In this module we will continue to populate NetBox with data for our fictional organization. Our intrepid Network Engineer Susan will be ..... making use of

By the end of this module you will be able to:  
- 

## Why Use Ansible? 
You can obviously add all this data manually via the Web Interface, but by getting hands on with the REST API, you will start to take your skills with NetBox to the next level! A lot of Network Engineers have never used an API (they have surely heard of them by now though) and they might be unsure of how to work with one, or why they should even bother. 

The goal of this module is to demystify REST API's and show you how powerful and simple to use the NetBox REST API is. You will quickly start to see how you can interact programmatically with NetBox and how NetBox can drive your Network Automation efforts going forward.

## Get Hands On
If you'd like to follow along with the examples used in this course, it's super easy to do, and you have a few options: 
1.  Run NetBox as a container with [NetBox Docker](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox-docker) - This is the quickest way to get your own dedicated NetBox instance going and it only takes a few minutes to spin up on your laptop!
2.  Follow the [official documentation](https://docs.netbox.dev/en/stable/installation/) and do a full installation all the NetBox components. These instructions have been tested on Ubuntu and CentOS Linux.
3.  Use the public [demo instance](https://demo.netbox.dev/) of NetBox   

The NetBox version used in the video for this module is v3.3.2, and the following course materials used in the demo are available: 
- [Postman collection](../../postman/NetBox-Zero-to-Hero.postman_collection.json) for making API calls
- [YAML files](../3-adding-the-kit/yaml_data/) used for device types



## Video - Adding IPAM Data Into NetBox
The video demo will now show you how to .... As always the best way to understand the power of NetBox is to dive right in, so let's get started!

If you are following along, don't forget to use the Ansible Playbooks used for adding device types.

OK, so now you know how to ...... in the next module you will learn how to....
